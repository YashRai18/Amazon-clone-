# Amazon-clone
Hey Everyone, I have built an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS only, where I have created a replica of Amazon India. Still, it does not possess any functionality yet. I am open to further Improvements that make my code better.
Approximately every style is exactly similar to the one present on the Amazon website. Animations are useful in having the real feel of a website, as they grab the user's attention.

Technologies used - HTML and CSS
